# Overview

Build an unstructured data extraction system using a provided document corpus. You will have full autonomy over the technology stack and implementation approach. We heavily encourage the use of bleeding edge coding agents to develop the app and want to review your process and understanding of the system that is generated.

## Timeline

- **Deadline:** 7 days from receipt
- **Expected effort:** 4–8 hours

## Problem Description

The provided folder contains a corpus of documents with variable formatting, mixed file types, and structured data embedded within unstructured text. The goal is to design and implement a system that extracts meaningful, structured data from these documents.

The solution should include logic for parsing unstructured data as well as an API or interface to serve the processed data in a meaningful form.


1. **Loan Documents**

   Analyze the documents and produce a structured record for each borrower that includes extracted PII like their name, address, full income history, and associated account/loan numbers, with a clear reference to the original document(s) from which the information was sourced.

## Deliverables

### 1. System Design Document (Markdown)

- Architecture overview, including component diagram
- Data pipeline design covering ingestion, processing, storage, and retrieval
- AI/LLM integration strategy and model selection rationale
- Approach for handling document format variability
- Scaling considerations for 10x and 100x document volume
- Key technical trade-offs and reasoning
- Error handling strategy and data quality validation approach

### 2. Working Implementation

- Document ingestion pipeline
- Extraction logic using AI/LLM tooling
- Structured output generation (e.g., JSON or database-backed)
- Basic query or retrieval interface
- Test coverage for critical paths (encouraged but not required)

### 3. README

- Setup and run instructions
- Summary of architectural and implementation decisions

## Submission Instructions

You should submit your work as a git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or similar) containing all deliverables. A link to the repository should be emailed upon completion.

## Next Steps

After submission, you can expect to participate in three 45-minute follow-up sessions:

- **Development Tooling Approach** discussion of development environment and tooling approaches.
- **Systems Design Session:** walkthrough of design decisions and discussion of potential extensions.
- **Code Review Session:** review of implementation details and technical choices.

## Questions

We encourage you to reach out with any questions. Scope clarification is available, but implementation decisions are intentionally left open-ended.
